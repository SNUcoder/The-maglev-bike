# Maglev Bike
**Hello!**

I am Naveed Usman, The Author of this theory

I would like to present you my invention...

that would change the vehicle industry....

Me...

Naveed... Introducing....  **THE MAGLEV BIKE!**

You all might have seen a sci-fi movie where people would ride on floating bikes. this is what it is!

Allow me to explain how it works....

It rides on top of a road where magnets are placed....

it has many super-conductors attached which make it float on top of the magnetic "road".

It is just a theory for now.... until we test it
