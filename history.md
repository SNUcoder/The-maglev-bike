# History of the maglev bike

**Hello Again!**

I am Naveed as you might know me for my old documentation, about `Maglev Bike`.

here is a funny history, as a child I watch doraemon alot (yes, the robo cat from the future) even now I watch that show.

in one of the episode nobita (the charectar from that show) goes to the future, in that people ride on floating bikes.

```then, in my mind: "WOW, what if I can create a bike like that"```

after that "incident" maglev bike became my dream invention.

few years later I heard about maglev train in japan...

```then, in my mind: "WOW, wait... I can use this technology for my bike which i thought a few yeas ago"```

after this I started drawing got many ideas after many changes the design is ready.

now it jjust need to get a better design and test it...

after everything we will patent it (it will be open-source patent ;) )

the maglev bike been through many changes we will talk about it in other documentation

## Bye!
